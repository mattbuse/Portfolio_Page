          <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio page! I have been a Business Analyst at Nelnet for the past three years. During this time I have gained experience creating and modifying SQL reports. I also have experience using MS Visio to create process maps, and using Excel and Access for various projects. I'm currently learning how to use MS PowerApps.</p>
          <p>Recently I have decided to take training in order to move into an IT position. In November of 2022 I began the Full Stack Engineer Career Path on Codecademy. I've added skills that I am acquiring through this course in the section below. I am planning to finish the Full Stack path by Summer of 2023 and am interested in pursuing a career as a Software Engineer.</p>
          <p>If you would like to see what I have been working on, please click the 'PROJECTS' link above. Thank you for your time and interest!</p>

          <h3>More Info About Me <button id="hide-again">Hide</button></h3>
          <p>I was born in Nebraska and grew up in Oklahoma. I have a degree in Political Science from the University of Central Oklahoma, but have spent most of my time working with insurance and annuities.</p>
          <p>I love to learn and train others. When I'm not working I love to spend time with my wife and four kids (three daughters, one son), watch movies and sports, read and continue to learn new things!</p>
