          <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio page! I have been a Business Analyst at Nelnet for the past three years. During this time I have gained experience creating and modifying SQL reports. I also have experience using MS Visio to create process maps, and using Excel and Access for various projects. I'm currently learning how to use MS PowerApps.</p>
          <p>I've also begun training to move into an IT position. In November 2022 I began the Full Stack Engineer Career Path on Codecademy. I've added skills that I have acquired or will be acquiring through this course in the section below. I am planning to finish the Full Stack path by Summer 2023 and am interested in pursuing a career as a Software Engineer / Full Stack Developer.</p>
          <p>I have a strong work ethic, strong communication skills and am very reliable. I'm visually-oriented and learn best by getting hands-on experience.</p>
          <p>If you would like to see what I have been working on, please click the 'PROJECTS' link above. Thank you for your time and interest!</p>

          <h3>More About Me <button id="hide-again">Hide</button></h3>
          <p>I was born in Nebraska, but grew up in Oklahoma City and graduated from the University of Central Oklahoma. Six months later I moved to Lincoln, NE where I would eventually meet my wife. My degree is in Political Science, but I've spent most of my time working with insurance and annuities.</p>
          <p>I love to learn and share what I know with other people. When I'm not working I spend time with my wife and play games with our kids (three daughters, one son and a cat named Ophelia). I also love watching movies and sports, reading and continuing to learn new things. Here are some of my favorites, and a picture of the family.</p>
