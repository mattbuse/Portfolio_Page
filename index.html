          <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio page! I have been a Business Analyst at Nelnet for the past four years. During this time I have gained experience creating and modifying SQL reports. I also work with MS Visio to create process maps, as well as Excel, Access and SharePoint.</p>
          <p>I've also begun training to move into an IT position. In November 2022 I began the Full Stack Engineer <a href="JS-Projects/curriculum.html">Career Path</a> on Codecademy. I've added skills that I have learned or plan to learn below. I'm on track to finish the Full Stack path by the end of 2023 and am interested in pursuing a career as a Software Engineer / Web Developer.</p>
          <p>I have a strong work ethic with a 'never-give-up' attitude, strong communication skills and am very reliable. I excel at focusing on tasks and researching to problem solve independently. I'm patient, visually-oriented and learn best by getting hands-on experience. And I never want to stop learning because technology always amazes me.</p>
          <p>If you would like to see what I have been working on, please click on PROJECTS above. Thank you for your time!</p>

          <h3>More About Me <button id="hide-again">Hide</button></h3>
          <p>I was born in Nebraska, but grew up in Oklahoma City and graduated from the University of Central Oklahoma. Six months later I moved to Lincoln, NE where I would later meet my wife.</p>
          <p>I love to learn and share what I know with other people. When I'm not working I spend time with my wife and play games with our kids (three daughters, one son and a cat named Ophelia). I also love watching movies and sports, reading and continuing to learn new things. Here are some of my favorites, and a picture of the family.</p>
