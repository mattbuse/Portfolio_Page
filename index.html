          <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio page! I have been a Business Analyst at Nelnet for the past three years. During this time I have gained experience creating and modifying SQL reports. I also have experience using MS Visio to create process maps, and using Excel and Access for various projects. I'm currently learning how to use MS PowerApps.</p>
          <p>I've recently decided to train to move into an IT position. In November of 2022 I began the Full Stack Engineer Career Path on Codecademy. I've added skills that I have acquired or will be acquiring through this course in the section below. I am planning to finish the Full Stack path by Summer of 2023 and am interested in pursuing a career as a Software Engineer.</p>
          <p>I have a strong work ethic, strong communication skills and am very reliable. I'm a very visual person and learn best by getting my hands on things.</p>
          <p>If you would like to see what I have been working on, please click the 'PROJECTS' link above. Thank you for your time and interest!</p>

          <h3>More Info About Me <button id="hide-again">Hide</button></h3>
          <p>I was born in Nebraska, but grew up in Oklahoma City. I graduated from the University of Central Oklahoma in 2003. Six months later I moved to Lincoln, NE where I would eventually meet my wife. My degree is in Political Science, but I've spent most of my time working with insurance and annuities. I've been driving my Honda Civic since 2006 because I love it and it's been very good to me.</p>
          <p>I love to learn and share what I know with other people. When I'm not working I spend time with my wife and kids (three daughters, one son and a cat named Ophelia). I also love watching movies and sports, reading and continuing to learn new things! Here are some of my favorites, and a couple pictures of the family.</p>
