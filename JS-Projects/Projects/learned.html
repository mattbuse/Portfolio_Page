        <h3>Tips I've Learned About Learning to Code</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Be Patient. There is a lot to learn. It's going to take time.</li>
        <li>Approach everything with the confidence that eventually I will be able to teach this to others.</li>
        <li>Maintain a balance of spending time between Training Materials, YouTube Tutorials and Hands-on Practice.</li>
        <li>When I get stuck, take a break and come back.</li>
        <li>If I can't figure something out, go through this list in order:</li>
          <ul class="help-list">
            <li>DevTools</li>
            <li>Console.log</li>
            <li>ChatGPT</li>
            <li>Source Websites</li>
            <li>Google Searching</li>
            <li>YouTube Searching</li>
            <li>Post a Question on Message Boards</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Read a lot of other people's code and look up everything I can't explain.</li>
          <li>The first step in creating a successful project is breaking it down into smaller parts. And sometimes breaking those parts down even more.</li>
        <li>When something doesn't work, often it's because I'm skipping a step. Read through the code again and make sure I'm not trying to do two things at once.</li>
        <li>Take time to enjoy what I create, and also see if I can 'break' it as a user.</li>
        <li>If I stick to it, and follow this list...</li>
        </ol>
