          <p>Welcome to my first portfolio project. The instruction was to create a JavaScript function that would generate a random script (weather forecast, horoscope, etc). I came up with the idea to have someone give their opinion on random sports teams.</p>
          <p>So imagine that you are at a sports bar and just met a new friend who likes to talk sports, has a lot of opinions and seems to think he knows everything that's going to happen.</p>
          <p>Go ahead and ask him. He may tell you...</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What team is going to win it all</li>
            <li>What good team is going to disappoint people</li>
            <li>What bad team is going to surprise people</li>
            <li>How much money he has bet on a team</li>
          <p class="sad">Or, if one of his teams just lost and he's feeling down...</p>
            <li>He may not give you any opinion</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To add more variation to the project, type the acronym of the sport (NFL, NBA...) you are interested in hearing about.</p>
          <p>So go ahead! Have a drink and ask your new friend what he thinks.</p>
